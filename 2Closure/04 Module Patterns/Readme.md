# Module Patterns

- Practical usefulness
- Classic module pattern have two characters
	- There must be an **outer enclosing  function** that gets executed. Doesn't have IIFE.
	- **One or more Inner functions** returned from that function call.
- Make everything private that which need to be public.
- Modern module pattern
- **export** to that module
