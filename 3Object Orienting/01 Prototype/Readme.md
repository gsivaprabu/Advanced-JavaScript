# Prototype

- Object Orienting
 * Common OO patterns
 * prototype
 * "Inheritance" Vs "Behavior Delegation"

 - Every single **object** is built by a **constructor function**
 - LUA and Javascript only - moniker object oriented (Actually create a object without class)
 - Each time a constructor is called, a new object is created.
 - A constructor makes an object "based on" its own prototype.
 - A constructor makes an object **linked to** its own **prototype**
